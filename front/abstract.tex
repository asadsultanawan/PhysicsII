The property of a physical system by which the response to an applied force is delayed in its e?ect, is referred to as time-delay. Physical transmission of material, information or energy from one place to another, is always associated with time-delay. The size of delay is determined by the distance and the transmission speed. Some delays are short, some are very long. The presence of long delays makes system analysis and control design much more complex. What is worse is that some delays are too long to perceive and the system is misperceived as one without delays.
